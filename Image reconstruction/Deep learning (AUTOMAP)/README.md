AUTOMAP is a deep learning method, originally designed for [MRI image reconstruciton](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25988). Here, I modified the original network stucture for CT reconstruciton. It shows that with AUTOMAP, it is able to reconstruct the CT image with very little number of projection, meaning, with much less radiation dose than conventional methods.
