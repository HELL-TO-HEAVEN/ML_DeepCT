Traditionally, CT reconstruction relied on back projection, which is limited by the Nyquist sampling frequency. Algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) is an effective technique to combat this limitation and thus achieve a reduction in CT radiation dose and increase of time resolution.

In this example,l I showed how to use advanced CT reconstruction technique to increase the time resolution of dynamic CT.
